This is a folder with some reference information.
- **DriveGeneric.xml**<br>
This is a reference file that I used to set up and adjust the parameter when building a network in ArcGIS Network Analysis Tool.
- **river_bridges_ordering.xls.xml**<br>
This is Jessica's order of our river bridges.
- **RiverBridges.csv**<br>
This is a river bridge data file that I created by hand based on Regan's dataset. The start and end X, Y coordinates are points I selected from Google Map. Then I converted this CSV file to a shapefile in ArcGIS. The shapefile is used as a reference to river bridges for later analysis. 
- **solution for parallel lanes**<br>
This is a solution for parallel lanes that we discussed after one Wednesday's Office's Hour meeting.
